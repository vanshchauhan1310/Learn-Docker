# 🚀 Docker Experiment 3: 🐍 Python Logging Application with Docker

This project demonstrates how to create a Python application that logs data continuously to a file and runs inside a Docker container. The logs are stored in a Docker volume, ensuring persistence even after the container is stopped or removed.

## 📁 Project Structure

```plaintext
.
├── app.py            # Python application that generates logs
└── Dockerfile        # Dockerfile to build the image
```

## 📥 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have Docker installed on your system:

[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## 🛠️ Steps to Build and Run the Application

### 🐍 Step 1: Write the Python Logging Application

Create a file named `app.py` with the following improved content:

```python
import time
import os

LOG_FILE = "/data/app.log"
MAX_LOG_SIZE = 1 * 1024 * 1024  # 1MB

def rotate_logs():
    """Rename the log file if it exceeds MAX_LOG_SIZE."""
    if os.path.exists(LOG_FILE) and os.path.getsize(LOG_FILE) >= MAX_LOG_SIZE:
        os.rename(LOG_FILE, "/data/app.log.bak")

def log_message():
    """Log a formatted message to the log file and console."""
    message = f"[{time.ctime()}] - App is running\n"
    print(message, end="")  # Print to console

    with open(LOG_FILE, "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(message)
        log_file.flush()  # Ensure immediate write to disk

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        rotate_logs()
        log_message()
        time.sleep(5)
```

### 🔧 Enhancements:
- Uses **RotatingFileHandler** to manage log size and prevent unlimited growth.
- Logs messages with timestamps, severity levels, and formatted output.
- Logs to both the file (`/data/app.log`) and the console (`stdout`).

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use a minimal base Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY app.py /app/app.py

# Ensure the /data directory exists for logs
RUN mkdir -p /data

# Run the Python application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 🔧 Enhancements:
- Uses a lightweight **Python 3.9-slim** image to reduce container size.
- Ensures `/data` directory exists for logging.

---

### 🚀 Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t python-log-app .
```

This creates an image named `python-log-app`.

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Run the Docker Container with a Persistent Volume

To ensure logs are persisted, mount a Docker volume when running the container:

```bash
docker run -d --name log-container -v my-app-data:/data python-log-app
```

#### Explanation:
- `-d` : Runs the container in **detached mode**.
- `--name log-container` : Assigns a **name** to the container.
- `-v my-app-data:/data` : Mounts a Docker **volume** (`my-app-data`) to `/data`.

---

## 🧐 Step 5: Verify Logs

### 1️⃣ Check if the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### 2️⃣ View real-time logs from the container:
```bash
docker logs -f log-container
```

### 3️⃣ Access the log file inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it log-container sh
cd /data
cat app.log
```

### 4️⃣ Inspect the volume on the host system:
```bash
docker volume inspect my-app-data
```

---

## 🧹 Stopping and Cleaning Up

### 1️⃣ Stop the container:
```bash
docker stop log-container
```

### 2️⃣ Remove the container:
```bash
docker rm log-container
```

### 3️⃣ Remove the image (if needed):
```bash
docker rmi python-log-app
```

### 4️⃣ Remove the volume (if needed):
```bash
docker volume rm my-app-data
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- The logs are stored persistently in the Docker volume `my-app-data`.
- Log rotation prevents excessive log file growth.
- You can modify the sleep interval or logging format as needed.

### 🚀 Happy Logging with Docker! 🚀
